# ALX Project 0x04 – Counter App with useState

> This project demonstrates basic **state management** in React using the `useState` Hook. It builds upon `alx-project-0x03`, adding dynamic interactivity through React's built-in state system.

## 📌 Objective

Learn how to manage and update local component state using `useState`.

### 🧠 Why `useState`?

- Track dynamic data like counters, form inputs, toggles, etc.
- Automatically re-renders the component when the state changes.
- Clean and simple API for managing internal state in functional components.
